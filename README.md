# WMS [WORK IN PROGRESS]

Wills Media Server
==================
An all in one Media server with no pay for restrictions or paywalls


###### Note: I know including the libraries in github is a bad idea but there is no other solution that is applicable at the moment for a place which blocks all pip downloads

Requirements
============
- [ ] Python 3.5.x or higher

Starting WMS
============
To Start WMS all you need to do is navigate to the directory (after downloading and extracting the archive) and then run `main.py`
